# Kaiserreich Cloud School Project Website

Welcome to the Kaiserreich Cloud school project website! This website is hosted purely for fun and serves a specific purpose in relation to self-hosted email services. Please read below for more details on the purpose of this website and how it's utilized.

Project Overview
The Kaiserreich Cloud school project website is a simple HTML and CSS-based website designed in a school project in 2018. The website serves as a minimal online presence and is hosted at https://www.kaiserreich.cloud.

Purpose
The primary purpose of this website is to fulfill the requirements of certain mail providers that mandate a functional website with an "Impressum" (legal notice) section before allowing emails from a self-hosted mail server to be delivered to their servers. The website is maintained to ensure that self-hosted email services from Kaiserreich Cloud can successfully send emails to recipients who use such providers.


Please note that this website is not maintained or developed. Due to the fact that it was a school project and is now hosted only for the purpose already mentioned.
